 This project is mainly focused on the employment of UNet architecture for the segmentation of images in autonomous vehicles. In the past few years, deep learning has caused great advancements in computer vision and in this project we will be concentrating on one particular task involved in
 computer vision which is semantic segmentation. We intend to tackle this task using UNet, which is
 built upon a Fully Convolutional Neural Network that will predict the mask of the object in the image
 and then localize it to predict a class for each pixel of the image given as input. Typically convolutional
 networks are used for classification tasks but in areas like biomedical image processing it is desired to
 have localization included in the output which is what precisely UNet enables us to do with fewer
 training images and more detailed segmentations. We will be chiefly concerned with predicting a good
 segmentation map using UNet that is able to combine the local and contextual information to
 accomplish this task. The entire project will be implemented using Python in Jupyter Note Book
